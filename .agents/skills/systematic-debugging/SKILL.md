# Systematic Debugging

Find root cause before patching. Reproduce the failure when practical, or gather the
smallest discriminating evidence. Trace the earliest incorrect state, form a leading
hypothesis, test it, then apply the smallest complete fix. Add a regression test when the
repository supports it and verify adjacent behavior.

Do not mask root causes with retries, broad exception handling, exception swallowing,
state resets, or fallback logic unless technically justified. If evidence disproves the
hypothesis, discard it rather than layering patches around it.
