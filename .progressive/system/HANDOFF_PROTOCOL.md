# Handoff Protocol

Classify the session `IN PROGRESS`, `PHASE COMPLETE`, or `PROJECT COMPLETE`.
Roadmap stays canonical for phase status.

## Phase completion transaction

When a phase satisfies its acceptance criteria:

1. update Architecture/ADR/other canonical owners first when system shape or a consequential decision changed;
2. write the durable phase report under `.progressive/completions/<phase-name>.md` using `.progressive/templates/PHASE_COMPLETION.template.md`; Runtime uses `.progressive/completions/<phase-name>.md`;
3. persist a compact `## Completion Record` in the completed phase **before moving the Roadmap marker**. It should point to the final report and keep only the small cross-phase bridge needed for progressive context;
4. mark the completed phase `[x]` and exactly one next phase `[>]` when one exists;
5. overwrite `NEXT_SESSION.md` in place with only the hot state needed to continue.

The phase completion report is durable human-readable history. Capture evidence-bounded detail that would otherwise bloat hot context:
- **Outcome / Delivered** — capabilities and artifacts that now exist;
- **Implementation notes** — durable technical facts worth preserving, not a diff diary;
- **Decisions made** — consequences plus ADR/canonical references when applicable;
- **Deviations / technical debt** — gaps surviving completion;
- **Problems discovered** — durable issues/workarounds worth remembering;
- **Verification evidence** — checks actually observed and results;
- **Architectural impact / Follow-up** — what later phases may rely on and explicit later work.

A Completion Record remains compact durable routing history. Capture only:
- **Status / Completed** — completion state/date when useful;
- **Final report** — relative path to the phase completion report when one exists;
- **Outcome** — one concise result;
- **Validation summary** — only the evidence needed to trust the transition;
- **Decisions / Technical Debt affecting later phases** — concise consequences;
- **Handoff to Next Phase** — assumptions/capabilities the next phase may safely rely on.

Do not duplicate the full completion report inside the Completion Record. Normal warm-up reads only the compact Completion Record; the detailed report is read on demand when investigation, audit, or historical context requires it.

Backward compatibility: completed phases created before phase completion reports existed remain valid with only their existing `## Completion Record`. Do not force migrations merely to satisfy the new convention. Add a report retroactively only when its durable detail is materially useful.

For non-trivial tasks inside an active phase, keep a compact Task Completion note in the phase file when the result/evidence/decision matters later. Do not create one completion file per routine task.

If the session remains `IN PROGRESS`, keep the phase active and do not fabricate a phase completion report or completion record.

On project completion every phase is `[x]` and none is `[>]`.

## NEXT_SESSION semantics

`NEXT_SESSION.md` is volatile hot navigation, not project history. Overwrite it on each meaningful handoff; do not create an accumulating chain of `NEXT_SESSION_001.md`, `NEXT_SESSION_002.md`, etc. It contains only current phase, completed work from the just-ended session, verification, blockers/uncertainty, next action, and a ready-to-copy prompt. Durable completed-phase detail belongs in `.progressive/completions/` (Runtime: `.progressive/completions/`); the phase keeps only its compact Completion Record; full source history remains in version control when available.
